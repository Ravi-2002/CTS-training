        <p>
          Blocking a number for calls and text is easy, but there are a few
          things you should know beforehand. You can't block numbers that are on
          your account, emergency numbers that are not 10-digits (911, 411, etc.)
          or #MIN (to check your used minutes).
        </p>
      <br></br>
        <p>
          Your blocks expire after 90 days. You can either block it again or
          subscribe to FamilyBase* to block a number permanently.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          If you change your mind, you can review your blocked numbers and decide
          to unblock it by tapping the red X.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          *FamilyBase lets you permanently block incoming and outgoing calls for
          up to 20 US or international numbers.
