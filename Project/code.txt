      <p>
        Blocking a number for calls and text is easy, but there are a few
        things you should know beforehand. You can't block numbers that are on
        your account, emergency numbers that are not 10-digits (911, 411, etc.)
        or #MIN (to check your used minutes).
      </p>

      <p>
        Your blocks expire after 90 days. You can either block it again or
        subscribe to FamilyBase* to block a number permanently.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you change your mind, you can review your blocked numbers and decide
        to unblock it by tapping the red X.
      </p>

      <p>
        *FamilyBase lets you permanently block incoming and outgoing calls for
        up to 20 US or international numbers.
